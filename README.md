# Quokka
Video watching platform that converts video speech to sign language


Why do we need sign language if we have subtitles?
> It's much easier for sign language users to keep track of who's speaking with a sign language compared to subtitles.
> And unlike sign language interpretation, subtitles rarely indicate sound effects or music. 

## Currently drawing out the project plans, I would love to work on the project with more people that share the same desire to help others.
